# This is an AGI script to call servald to resolve a DID to a SID or SIP URI.
#
# An example dialplan is as follows
#
# [globals]
# SERVALD_AGI=/Users/darius/projects/serval/app_servaldna/servaldnaagi.py
# SERVALD_BIN=/Users/darius/projects/serval/batphone/jni/serval-dna/servald
# SERVALD_INSTANCE=/Users/darius/projects/serval/instance
#
# ; Try and resolve using script which asks servald
# exten => _X.,1,AGI(${SERVALD_AGI},${SERVALD_BIN},${SERVALD_INSTANCE},${EXTEN})
#    same => n,Verbose(AGI has run)
#    same => n,Goto(${AGISTATUS})
# ; Lookup failed (check servald is running etc)
#    same => n(FAILURE),Playback(tt-weasels)
#    same => n,Verbose(weasels)
#    same => n,Hangup()
# ; Lookup worked
#    same => n(SUCCESS),Verbose(lookup done)
#    same => n,Goto(${SDNAAGI_STATUS})
# ; Actually resolved something try and dial it
#    same => n(RESOLVED),Dial(${SDNAAGI_DEST},25)
#    same => n,Hangup()
# ; Couldn't find something for this DID
#    same => n(UNRESOLVED),Playback(ss-noservice)
#    same => n,Verbose(unresolved)
#    same => n,Hangup()
#
# This is slow because we are a Python script and we have to fork
# servald.  When the monitor interface grows a way to do queries then
# we can write a proper extension.
#
# Note that servald must be running as the same user as asterisk for this to work.
